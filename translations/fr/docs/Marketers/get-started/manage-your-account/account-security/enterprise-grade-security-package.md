> **At a glance:** Enhance your account protection with the **Enterprise-Grade Security Package,** a premium offering designed for enterprise-grade identity management, token access control, and extended audit visibility.

## Intro

The Enterprise-Grade Security Package brings together three key features that elevate your organization’s security:

* **Multi-token management with service restrictions**: Scalable token creation and granular access controls across APIs, S2S, and OneLink.
* **Audit log API with extended retention**: Gain long-term visibility into platform activity and integrate audit events into your monitoring stack.
* **SCIM provisioning**: Automate and centralize user access control via your identity provider.
* **IP allowlist for Login:** Prevent unauthorized access, ensuring log in to the AppsFlyer dashboard from only trusted networks and IPs

<div id="multitoken-management-with-restrictions" />

<Accordion title="Multi-Token Management with Restrictions">

Create and manage up to **30 tokens** per type (API, S2S, OneLink) with **service-level restrictions** to enhance scalability, security, and control over tokens.

#### Key features

* Admins can create up to **30 tokens per type**, compared to the 2 tokens with the standard tokens, supporting larger teams and complex workflows.​
* Assign service-specific access permissions to API tokens, restricting access to sensitive operations.​
* Tokens can be revoked or rotated without breaking integrations or automations.
* Restrict a token to a specific app so the token can only access data or perform actions for that app.
* Simplifies collaboration with internal teams and external partners through token-specific permissions.

> 📄 **Example**
>
> Create two tokens to help maintain least-privilege access and prevent accidental data exposure.
>
> **Data only access token:** Create a token that accesses aggregated data only. This token won’t be able to access raw data or perform actions like configuration changes. Use this for analytics teams or read-only agency users.
>
> **Settings-only access token:** Issue a token that lets internal teams manage configuration settings but doesn’t allow them to pull data. This isolates admin capabilities from data access.
>
> **App-specific access token:** Create a token that works for one app only. Use this token when an internal team, external partner, or automation must access only a specific app.

> 📘 **Note**
>
> For general information about standard tokens, see <Anchor target="_blank" href="/marketers/docs/managing-appsflyer-tokens">managing AppsFlyer tokens</Anchor>.

2. Go to the **Token Management** page.
3. Click **Create Token**.
4. Select the token type:
   * API
   * S2S
   * OneLink
5. For **API tokens**, select one or more services from the **Access restriction** dropdown.  
   Access is binary: full access or none.
6. Select the restriction type:
   1. Service restriction: Select one or more services from the **Access restriction** drop-down list.
   2. App restriction: Select the app that the token can access.
7. Click **Save**

**Manage tokens**

To manage your tokens, from the top bar, open the account menu (email address dropdown) -> **Security center -> Token Management** page.

Here you can:

* View token metadata: name, type, restrictions, creation/expiration
* Delete tokens individually
* Monitor token activity in audit logs

> 📘 **Note**
>
> Tokens cannot be edited. To change access, delete, and recreate a token.

</Accordion>

<div id="audit-log-api-and-extended-retention" />

<Accordion title="Audit log API and extended retention">

Enhancing the existing audit log capabilities, this feature introduces an API for audit log consumption and extends data retention from 90 days to 180 days. Ideal for teams needing long-term access to user action logs or integrating audit events into external monitoring tools like SOC and SEIM.

#### Key features

* Access audit logs programmatically using a dedicated API
* Retain logs for up to **180 days**, compared to 90 days with the standard audit logs
* Filter and export data for compliance, security, or operational use
* Use service-specific tokens to isolate log access
* Export data to SIEM tools, dashboards, or cloud storage

> 📘 **Note**
>
> For general information about the standard audit log, see <Anchor target="_blank" href="/marketers/docs/audit-log">Standard audit log</Anchor>.

### **How to access the audit log via API**

To use the Audit Log API:

1. From the top bar, open the account menu (email address dropdown): **Security Center.**
2. In the **Audit log** section, click **View audit log.**
3. Go to the **Token Management** page.
4. Use an existing or create a new **API token**.
5. Under **Access restriction**, select **Audit log** service.
6. Use the token to authenticate requests to the audit log API endpoint.

> 📘 **Note**
>
> Make sure to store your API token securely. It can’t be retrieved after creation.

<Accordion title="SSO and SCIM provisioning">

SCIM provisioning enhances AppsFlyer SSO capabilities by automating user lifecycle management directly from your identity provider (IdP), such as Okta, Entra ID (Azure), OneLogin, JumpCloud, or self-managed IDPs supporting attribute-based access. This allows organizations to onboard, update, or deactivate users without manual intervention.

By syncing users via SCIM, you maintain full control over access permissions in real-time. Combined with SAML 2.0 SSO, this forms a complete identity and access management solution for enterprise customers.

#### **Key features**

* Automatically create users in AppsFlyer based on identity provider (IdP) records.
* Changes in user roles or status in the IdP are instantly reflected in AppsFlyer.
* Uses **SAML 2.0** for secure SSO and **SCIM** for provisioning—compatible with leading IdPs like Okta and Azure AD.

#### **How to set up SCIM provisioning**

To start using SCIM provisioning in AppsFlyer, you need to:

1. [Set up SSO](/docs/enterprise-grade-security-package#sso-set-up)
2. [Enable SCIM](/docs/enterprise-grade-security-package#enable-scim)

<div id="ip-allowlist" />

<Accordion title="IP allowlist for Login">

Enhanced IP allowlisting improves security by preventing unauthorized access, ensuring only trusted networks can interact with the platform. This feature is especially valuable for enterprises enforcing strict security policies or managing remote access.

#### Key features

* Reduces attacks by blocking login attempts from unknown IPs.
* Enables the ability to specify IP addresses or ranges to ensure that only authorized users and networks can access the platform.
* Ideal for organizations using VPNs or requiring stricter access controls.

#### Adding IPs to the list

1. From the top bar, open the account menu (email address dropdown) > **Security center**.
2. In the **Login IP allowlist** section, click **Manage IP allowlist**.
3. Add IPs manually or via a CSV upload.

      1. Examples: `192.168.1.1`, `185.114.120.140`
      2. To enter a range of IP addresses, use this format: `185.114.120.1/32`  
         (where `185.114.120.1` is the first address in the range and `185.114.120.32` is the last address in the range).
4. Added IPs will be shown on the right side under **See your IPs in the IP allowlist**.
5. Click **Save list**.

> 🚧 **Important!**
>
> * Make sure the IP addresses or ranges you add are correct. Incorrect entries may prevent you from accessing your account.
