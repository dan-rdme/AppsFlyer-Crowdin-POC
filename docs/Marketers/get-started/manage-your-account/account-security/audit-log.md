> **At a glance:** Identify and protect against unauthorized access to your AppsFlyer account using the Audit log. View and download a summary of security-related activity in your account.

## Overview

The **Audit log** provides a central location to review various activities in your account, such as logins, data access, API calls, configuration and permission modifications to integrated partners, validation rules, audiences, and other significant events. This plays a key role in ensuring transparency, security, and adherence to compliance standards. To protect the security of your AppsFlyer account, it's recommended to periodically review **who** is accessing your account and **how** it is being accessed. Audit log data is available for the past 90 days.

**To access the Audit log:**

1. From the top bar, open the account menu (email address dropdown): **Security center.**
2. In the **Audit log** section, click **View audit log.**

## Troubleshooting

<div id="why-does-an-advertiser-audit-log-show-partner-api-call-requests" />

<Accordion title="Why does an advertiser's audit log show partner API call requests?">

When a partner makes an API request on an app owned by an advertiser, both the partner and the advertiser see the request in their audit log.

When an advertiser makes an API request using their own token, it will only show in the advertiser's audit log.
